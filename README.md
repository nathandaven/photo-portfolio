## Personal Portfolio (2023)

Remaking my personal portfolio site. Hoping to establish a more creative focus,putitng my photography on the forefront. Looking to establish a simpler design, that combines retro 2000s website elements with modern responsive design principles.

### Goals:

- [x] Homepage with rotating images
- [ ] Improve Google Photos API to cache results for quicker & better looking loading (options include a github action to manage API and store in repo, or implement caching thru Next.js, or both)
- [ ] Implement an overall design language that fits better with my goals
- [ ] Port over the most important info from old site, while consolidating and simplifying
- [ ] Consider a new CMS that fits better with the project. Contentful was a bit clunky for me.

## Technologies used

- Next.JS
- React
- Vercel deployment
- Rest API's using Next.js api routes
- Google Photos
- A to be determined CMS
